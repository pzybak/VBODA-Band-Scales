# VBODA Band Scales
A collection of all 12 major scales and a chromatic scale for each instrument, in alignment with VBODA All-State audition requirements.

All major scales are named in both concert pitch and transposed pitch, so that they can easily be played in a full ensemble setting.

These were made with my group's instrumentation in mind--feel free to download the notation file if you wish to add more color instruments, adapt this to your group, or change it in any way!
